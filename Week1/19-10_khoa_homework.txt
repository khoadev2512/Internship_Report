Question1: All type of join in Mysql:

		SELECT customers.customer_id, orders.order_id
		FROM customers
		[Type of JOIN] orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
		
	    R:
		A B C
		1 2 3
		4 5 6
		1 2 7
		8 4 5
		
	    S:
	    	P Q
	    	1 5
		3 7

	a. JOIN = INNER JOIN: Retrieves rows from both tables where there is a match based on the specified condition.
	
	SELECT * 
	FROM R 
	JOIN S ON R.A = S.P
	
		A B C P Q
		1 2 3 1 5
		1 2 7 1 5
		
		
	b. LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there's no match in the right table, NULL values are returned
	     
	SELECT * 
	FROM R 
	LEFT JOIN S ON R.A = S.P
		
		A B C P    Q
		1 2 3 1    5
		1 2 7 1    5
		4 5 6 null null
		8 4 5 null null


	c. RIGHT JOIN: retrieves all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. Rows with no match in the left table result in NULL values
		
	SELECT * 
	FROM R 
	RIGHT JOIN S ON R.A = S.P
	
		A    B    C    P Q
		1    2    3    1 5
		1    2    7    1 5
		null null null 3 7

 	 
	d. FULL JOIN: Retrieves all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. Rows with no match in either table result in NULL values
	
	SELECT * 
	FROM R 
	FULL JOIN S ON R.A = S.P
	
		A    B    C    P    Q
		1    2    3    1    5
		1    2    7    1    5
		4    5    6    null null
		8    4    5    null null
		null null null 3    7

	e. CROSS JOIN: Retrieves the Cartesian product of two tables, resulting in all possible combinations of rows from both tables.
	
	SELECT *
	FROM R 
	CROSS JOIN S
	
		A B C P Q
		1 2 3 1 5
		1 2 3 3 7
		4 5 6 1 5
		4 5 6 3 7
		1 2 7 1 5
		1 2 7 3 7 
		8 4 5 1 5
		8 4 5 3 7
	
	f. NATURAL JOIN: matches rows from two tables where the column names are the same and does not require you to specify the join condition explicitly
		
	    R:
		A B C
		1 2 3
		4 5 6
		1 2 7
		8 4 5
		
	    S:
	    	A D
	    	1 5
		3 7
	
	SELECT *
	FROM R 
	NATURAL JOIN S
		
		A B C D
		1 2 3 5
		1 2 7 5
		

		
Question2: Sub-query

	A subquery (or sub-query) in MySQL is a query that is nested within another query. Subqueries are used to retrieve data based on the results of another query and are commonly used in various SQL 			
	operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more. Subqueries are also known as inner queries or nested queries
	
	SELECT A.AGENT_CODE, A.AGENT_NAME
	FROM AGENTS A
	WHERE A.AGENT_CODE IN (
	    SELECT AGENT_CODE
	    FROM CUSTOMER
	    GROUP BY AGENT_CODE
	    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT WORKING_AREA) > 1
	);
