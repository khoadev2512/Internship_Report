Set: a "set" typically refers to a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements without any specific order
	
	require 'set'
	my_set = Set.new
	my_set.add("apple")
	my_set.add("banana")
	
	set1 = Set.new([1, 2, 3])
	set2 = Set.new([3, 4, 5])

	union_set = set1 | set2  # Union
	intersection_set = set1 & set2  # Intersection
	difference_set = set1 - set2  # Difference
