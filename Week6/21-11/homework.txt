Active record Serialize
	* Usage: 
		Serialize method in ActiveRecord is used to store complex data types (such as arrays, hashes, or other Ruby objects) in a single database column. 
		This is particularly useful when you need to store non-trivial data structures in a database field.
		 
	* Example with Array:
		class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
		  serialize :tags, Array, coder: JSON
		end
		
		post = Post.create
		post.tags = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
		post.save	# this array was saved as a text in database

		reload!
		post = Post.first
		post.tags 	# => We will get the array: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
		
		
	* Example with Hash:
		class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
		  serialize :tags, Hash, coder: JSON
		end

		post = Post.create
		post.tags = {twitter_handle: "@BrianVanLoo", location: "CA"}
		post.save	# this hash was saved as a text in database

		reload!
		post = Post.last
		post.tags 	# => We will get the hash: {twitter_handle: "@BrianVanLoo", location: "CA"}
