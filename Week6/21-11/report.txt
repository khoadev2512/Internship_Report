Distinguish between scope and class methods
	Scope:
		- Create a reusable query that can be used in various places within a model
		
		- It is typically used to encapsulate commonly used queries, making code more readable and DRY
		
		- Scppres are typically called on the model class itself
		
		- Scopes are defined using the scope method.
		
	Class:
		- Used for defining operations that involve the entire class or are related to the class as a whole
		
		- Class methods are defined using the def self.method_name syntax.

		Class methods are called on the class itself.
