Distinguish instance variable va class variable in Ruby 
	
	Instance variables:
		- Instance variables are associated with a specific instance (object) of a class.
		- They begin with the "@" symbol, followed by the variable name (e.g., @name, @age).
		- Each instance of a class can have its own unique set of instance variables with different values.
		- Instance variables store data that is specific to an individual object and can have different values for each object.

	Class variables:
		- Class variables are associated with a class itself and are shared among all instances of the class.
		- They begin with the "@@" symbol, followed by the variable name (e.g., @@count, @@total).
		- Class variables are not tied to a specific instance and are accessible from both class methods and instance methods within the class.
		- Class variables store data that is shared among all instances of the class.

	Ex:
		class Person
		  @@count = 0		# This is class variable

		  def initialize(name)
		    @name = name	# This is insctance variable
		    @@count += 1
		  end

		  def self.total_count
		    @@count
		  end
		end

		class Car
		  @@total_cars = 0 	# class variable

		  def initialize(make, model)
		    @make = make # instance variable
		    @model = model 	# instance variable
		    @@total_cars += 1
		  end

		  def self.total_cars 	# class method
		    @@total_cars
		  end

		  def make_and_model 	# instance method
		    "#{@make} #{@model}"
		  end
		end

		car1 = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")
		car2 = Car.new("Honda", "Accord")

		puts car1.make_and_model # "Toyota Camry"
		puts car2.make_and_model # "Honda Accord"

		puts Car.total_cars # 2		



Method Visibility: private and protected
	
	private:
		- Methods declared as private can only be called from within the class itself. They cannot be called from outside the class, not even by instances of the class.
		- Subclasses of the class cannot access private methods either.

	protected:
		- Methods declared as protected can be called from within the class itself and from subclasses of the class. They cannot be called from outside the class using an instance of the class.
		- This provides a level of visibility that is more restrictive than public but less restrictive than private.
		
	Ex:
		class MyClass
		  def public_method
		    puts "This is a public method"
		  end

		  private

		  def private_method
		    puts "This is a private method"
		  end	
		
		  protected

		  def protected_method
		    puts "This is a protected method"
		  end
		end

		class SubClass < MyClass
		  def access_protected
		    protected_method 		# Accessing a protected method from a subclass is allowed
		  end
		end

		obj = MyClass.new
		obj.private_method   		# This will raise an error
		obj.protected_method 		# This will raise an error
		sub = SubClass.new
		sub.protected_method




Operator "||="

	It is used for conditional assignment. It is often referred to as the "or equals" operator. 
	The purpose of ||= is to assign a value to a variable if and only if that variable is currently nil (or false, which is treated similarly to nil in a boolean context). 
	If the variable already has a non-nil value, the ||= operator will not reassign it.
	
	Ex:
		# Example 1: Setting a default value
		name = nil
		name ||= "John Doe"
		puts name # Output: "John Doe"

		# Example 2: Avoiding reassignment
		num = 5
		num ||= 10
		puts num # Output: 5

		# Example 3: Setting a default value for a hash key
		person = {}
		person[:name] ||= "John Doe"
		puts person # Output: {:name=>"John Doe"}

		# Example 4: Avoiding reassignment for a hash key
		person = { name: "Jane Doe" }
		person[:name] ||= "John Doe"
		puts person # Output: {:name=>"Jane Doe"}
